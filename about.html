    <h2><u><center>The History of Vache Noire</center></h2></u>
    <h3><center>Established on August 8th, 1934, our founders Jules and Violette Clément were a married couple who have had a heavy passion and love for cafés.</center></h3>
    <h3><center>This passion was so great that the two decided to open their own café right in the center of New York City.</center></h3>
    <h3><center>From then on Jules and Violette dedicated the rest of their lives to the success and growth of Vache Noire.</center></h3>
    <h3><center>Today, we can happily say the same. The children of the couple still work hard to maintain the café and treat it with the love and respect that their parents did.</center></h3>
