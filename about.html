    <h2><u>The History of Vache Noire</h2></u>
    <h3>Established on August 8th, 1934, our founders Jules and Violette Clément were a married couple who have had a heavy passion and love for cafés.</h3>
    <h3>This passion was so great that the two decided to open their own café right in the center of New York City.</h3>
    <h3>From then on Jules and Violette dedicated the rest of their lives to the success and growth of Vache Noire.</h3>
    <h3>Today, we can happily say the same. The children of the couple still work hard to maintain the café and treat it with the love and respect that their parents did. </h3>
